Where it is clear that the below content has not read, the issue is likely to be closed with "please read the template". Please don't take offense at this. It is simply a time management decision. When someone raises an issue, without reading the template, then often too much time is spent going back and forth to obtain information that is outlined below.


#### You should already be a Patron

To be using Fody you should be a [Patron](https://opencollective.com/fody/order/3059). See [Licensing/Patron FAQ](https://github.com/Fody/Fody#licensingpatron-faq). With that in mind, it is assumed anyone proposing a feature is already a Patron. As such your GitHub Id may be verified against [OpenCollective contributors](https://opencollective.com/fody#contributors). This process will depend on the quality of the proposal, your circumstances, and the impact on the larger user base.

If you are not able, or don't have the time, to implement the feature, and would prefer someone else implement it for you, consider proposing a [once off donation](https://opencollective.com/fody/donate) amount. When considering the amount, note that features can take many hours to implement.


#### Guidance

If you are certain the feature will be accepted, it is better to raise a [PR](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

If you are uncertain if the feature will be accepted, outline the proposal to confirm it is viable.

Even if the feature is a good idea and viable, it may not be accepted since the ongoing effort in maintaining the feature may outweigh the benefit it delivers.


#### Is the proposal related to a problem

A description of what the problem is.


#### Describe the solution

A proposal of how you plan to implement the feature. Also include any alternative solutions considered.
