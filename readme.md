### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fody/Fody/master/package_icon.png" height="28px"> Extensible tool for weaving .net assemblies

Manipulating the IL of an assembly as part of a build requires a significant amount of plumbing code. This plumbing code involves knowledge of both the MSBuild and Visual Studio APIs. Fody attempts to eliminate that plumbing code through an extensible add-in model.

## Licensing/Patron FAQ

**It is expected that all developers [become a Patron](https://opencollective.com/fody/order/3059) to use Fody.**


### Enforcement

It is an honesty system with no code or legal enforcement. When raising an issue or a pull request, the users may be checked against [the list of backers](https://github.com/Fody/Fody/blob/master/backers.md), and that issue/PR may be closed without further examination.


### So what OSS license are projects using?

Fody is licensed under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


### Why charge for open source?

 * [Open-Source Maintainers are Jerks!](https://vimeo.com/296579853)
 * [FOSS is free as in toilet](http://unhandledexpression.com/general/2018/11/27/foss-is-free-as-in-toilet.html)
 * [How to Charge for your Open Source](https://www.mikeperham.com/2015/11/23/how-to-charge-for-your-open-source/)
 * [Sustain OSS: The Report](https://sustainoss.org/assets/pdf/SustainOSS-west-2017-report.pdf)
 * [Open Source Maintainers Owe You Nothing](https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/03/19/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/)
 * [Who should fund open source projects?](https://jaxenter.com/who-funds-open-source-projects-133222.html)
 * [Apply at OSS Inc today](https://twitter.com/ryanchenkie/status/1067801413974032385)


### But shouldn't OSS be completely free and supported by the community through their contributions?

Yes in theory this is true, however the long term reality has shown this not to be the case. The vast majority of consumers of open source projects do not contribute enough to ensure those project survive. This results in a small core team spending large amounts of their own free time maintaining projects.


### But it is MIT, can't I use it for free?

Yes all projects are under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and you can ignore the community backing honesty system and use these project for free.


### Do I need to be a Patron to contribute a Pull Request?

Yes. You must be a Patron to be a user of the below NuGet packages. Contributing Pull Requests does not cancel this out. It may seem unfair to expect people both contribute PRs and also financially back this project. However it is important to remember the effort in reviewing and merging a PR is often similar to that of creating the PR. Also the project maintainers are committing to support that added code (feature or bug fix) for the life of the project.


### Can I fork, re-use code, or start competing (possibly commercial) projects?

Yes.


### Do all developers in a company need to become Patrons?

No. Only those coding against projects that directly, or indirectly, consume the Fody NuGet package.


### What happens if I produce a libraries using Fody?

Consumers of that produced library do not need to become Patrons.



<a href="#" id="endofbacking"></a>



## Usage

Install using [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/nuget/). See [Using the package manager console](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/nuget/tools/package-manager-console) for more info.

Fody ships in two parts:

 1. The core "engine" shipped in the [Fody NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fody/)
 1. Any number of ["addins" or "weavers"](#addins-list) which are all shipped in their own NuGet packages.

The below examples will use [Virtuosity](https://github.com/Fody/Virtuosity).


### Install Fody

Since NuGet always defaults to the oldest, and most buggy, version of any dependency it is important to do a [NuGet install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/ps-ref-install-package) of Fody after installing any weaver.

```
Install-Package Fody
```

[Subscribe to Fody](https://libraries.io/nuget/Fody) on [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) to get notified of releases of Fody.


### Add the nuget

[Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/ps-ref-install-package) the package in the project:

```
Install-Package WeaverName.Fody
```

e.g.

```
Install-Package Virtuosity.Fody
```


### Add FodyWeavers.xml

To indicate what weavers run and in what order a `FodyWeavers.xml` file is used at the project level. It needs to be added manually. It takes the following form:


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Weavers>
  <WeaverName/> 
</Weavers>
```

e.g.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Weavers>
  <Virtuosity/> 
</Weavers>
```

The [Project Configuration Manager](https://github.com/tom-englert/ProjectConfigurationManager/wiki/6.-Fody) provides an interactive tool that can support you configuring your weavers, which is especially helpful in solutions with many projects.


## Supported Visual Studio Versions

To build a project using Fody you will need:

 * Visual Studio 2017 or later
 * .Net >= 4.6

Older versions of Visual Studio may still work, but are not actively supported. We do our best to not break backward compatibility, but can't guarantee this forever.


## Supported Runtimes

 * Classic .NET: See *Support ended* in [NET Framework version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#Overview). i.e only 4.5.2 and above is supported.
 * .NET core: Follows [.NET Core Support Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/support).

No explicit code is in place to check for non supported versions, and throw an error. As such earlier versions of .net may work as a side effect. 
It's all up to the individual weavers that you use and what version they are able to support.

Any bugs found must be reproduced in a supported version.

Downstream plugins are recommended to follow the above guidelines.


### Reasons

While it may seam trivial to "implement support for earlier versions of .net" the long term support implications are too costly. For example to support earlier versions of .net require 

 * Custom VMs to verify problems.
 * Added complexity to setting up build environment.
 * Bugs in unsupported versions in .NET may be manifest as bugs in Fody.


## Edit and continue

Edit and continue is not supported. There is no extension point to re-weave an assembly after the edit part.


## Project formats

The following are not supported

 * Projects using the [project.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/project-json).
 * Projects using the xproj.
 * Projects mixing the old `.csproj` format with new [`<PackageReference>` nodes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#adding-a-packagereference).

To tell the difference between the old and new csproj formats.

The old format starts with

```
<Project ToolsVersion="15.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
```

The new format starts with

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
```

For all these scenarios is it instead recommended to move to the new VS 2017 SDK style projects.

## Why? 

This technique of "weaving" in new instructions is fantastically powerful. You can turn simple public properties into full [INotifyPropertyChanged implementations](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged), add [checks for null arguments](https://github.com/Fody/NullGuard), add [Git hashes to your Assemblies](https://github.com/Fody/Stamp), even [make all your string comparisons case insensitive](https://github.com/Fody/Caseless).


## The plumbing tasks Fody handles

  * Injection of the MSBuild task into the build pipeline
  * Resolving the location of the assembly and pdb
  * Abstracts the complexities of logging to MSBuild
  * Reads the assembly and pdb into the Mono.Cecil object model
  * Re-applying the strong name if necessary
  * Saving the assembly and pdb

Fody Uses [Mono.Cecil](http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil/)  and an add-in based approach to modifying the IL of .net assemblies at compile time.

 * No install required to build
 * No attributes required
 * No references required


## Naming

The name "Fody" comes from the small birds that belong to the weaver family [Ploceidae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fody).
