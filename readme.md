### <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fody/Fody/master/package_icon.png" height="28px"> Extensible tool for weaving .net assemblies

Manipulating the IL of an assembly as part of a build requires a significant amount of plumbing code. This plumbing code involves knowledge of both the MSBuild and Visual Studio APIs. Fody attempts to eliminate that plumbing code through an extensible add-in model.

**This is the codebase of core Fody engine. For more information on the larger Fody project see https://github.com/Fody/Home.**

## Community backed

Fody requires significant effort to maintain. As such it relies on financial contributions from the community and sponsorship to ensure its long term viability. **It is expected that all developers using Fody [become a Patron on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/fody/order/3059).**
