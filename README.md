## Extensible tool for weaving .net assemblies

## Introduction 

Manipulating the IL of an assembly as part of a build requires a significant amount of plumbing code. This plumbing code involves knowledge of both the MSBuild and Visual Studio APIs. Fody attempts to elimination that plumbing code through an extensible add-in model. 

## Why? 

This technique of "weaving" in new instructions is fantastically powerful. You can turn simple public properties into full [INotifyPropertyChanged implementations](https://github.com/SimonCropp/PropertyChanged), add [checks for null arguments](https://github.com/SimonCropp/NullGuard.Fody), add [Git hashs to your Assemblies](https://github.com/SimonCropp/Stamp), even [make all your string comparisons case insensitive](https://github.com/SimonCropp/Caseless). 

### Note: 
Users of the INotifyPropertyWeaver extension who are migrating to Fody will want to NuGet Install the PropertyChanged.Fody package along with the Fody package itself to get the same functionality as before. This is because Fody is a general purpose weaver with plugins while INotifyPropertyWeaver was specific to one scenario. That scenario now lives in the [PropertyChanged addin](https://github.com/SimonCropp/PropertyChanged).

## The plumbing tasks Fody handles 

  * Injection of the MSBuild task into the build pipeline
  * Resolving the location of the assembly and pdb
  * Abstracts the complexities of logging to MSBuild
  * Reads the assembly and pdb into the Mono.Cecil object model
  * Re-applying the strong name if necessary
  * Saving the assembly and pdb

Fody Uses [Mono.Cecil](http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil)  and an add-in based approach to modifying the IL of .net assemblies at compile time.

 * No install required to build
 * No attributes required
 * No references required
 * Supports .net 3.5, .net 4, .net 4.5, Silverlight 4, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 7, Windows Phone 8, Metro on Windows 8, Mono, MonoTouch, MonoDroid and PCL

## Visual Studio Addin

There is a  [Visual Studio addin](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/074a2a26-d034-46f1-8fe1-0da97265eb7a) 

## Usage

See [SampleUsage](https://github.com/SimonCropp/Fody/wiki/SampleUsage) for an introduction on using Fody.

## Naming

The name "Fody" comes from the small birds that belong to the weaver family [Ploceidae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fody).
