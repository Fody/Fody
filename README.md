## Extensible tool for weaving .net assemblies

## Introduction 

Manipulating the IL of an assembly as part of a build requires a significant amount of plumbing code. This plumbing code involves knowledge of both the MSBuild and Visual Studio APIs. Fody attempts to eliminate that plumbing code through an extensible add-in model. 

## The nuget package

https://nuget.org/packages/Fody/

## Why? 

This technique of "weaving" in new instructions is fantastically powerful. You can turn simple public properties into full [INotifyPropertyChanged implementations](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged), add [checks for null arguments](https://github.com/Fody/NullGuard), add [Git hashes to your Assemblies](https://github.com/Fody/Stamp), even [make all your string comparisons case insensitive](https://github.com/Fody/Caseless). 

### Note: NotifyPropertyWeaver

Users of the [NotifyPropertyWeaver](https://github.com/SimonCropp/NotifyPropertyWeaver) extension who are migrating to [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/fody) will want to use NuGet to Install the PropertyChanged.Fody package along with Fody itself to get the same functionality as before. This is because Fody is a general purpose weaver with plugins while NotifyPropertyWeaver was specific to one scenario. That scenario now lives in the [PropertyChanged addin](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged). See [Converting from NotifyPropertyWeaver](https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged/wiki/ConvertingFromNotifyPropertyWeaver) for more information. 

## The plumbing tasks Fody handles 

  * Injection of the MSBuild task into the build pipeline
  * Resolving the location of the assembly and pdb
  * Abstracts the complexities of logging to MSBuild
  * Reads the assembly and pdb into the Mono.Cecil object model
  * Re-applying the strong name if necessary
  * Saving the assembly and pdb

Fody Uses [Mono.Cecil](http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil)  and an add-in based approach to modifying the IL of .net assemblies at compile time.

 * No install required to build
 * No attributes required
 * No references required
 * Supports .net 3.5, .net 4, .net 4.5, Silverlight 4, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 7, Windows Phone 8, Metro on Windows 8, Mono, MonoTouch, MonoDroid and PCL 

## Usage

See [SampleUsage](https://github.com/Fody/Fody/wiki/SampleUsage) for an introduction on using Fody.

## Naming

The name "Fody" comes from the small birds that belong to the weaver family [Ploceidae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fody).
