If you have nuget package restore turned on you probably need to do a build to download the weavers.
Alternatively you may have added a weaver to your 'FodyWeavers.xml' and forgot to add the appropriate NuGet package.
Perhaps you need to run 'Install-Package {0}.Fody'. This url may provide more information http://nuget.org/packages/{0}.Fody/ .", weaverConfig.AssemblyName);
